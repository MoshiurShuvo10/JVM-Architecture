# JVM-Architecture
  - ## The basic architecture is
       - Class Loader Subsystem reads the .class file and stores the information into Memory area.
       - Execution Engine reads the necessary info from the memory area and runs a program.
       - Using Java Native Library, Execution Engine reads the Native Method Libraries of JVM.
